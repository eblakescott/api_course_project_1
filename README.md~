api_course_project_1
====================

For this intial project I wanted to test javascript's capabilities regarding cleaning and processing text. For the data I used the NYTimes API to retrieve JSON data that contained comments to an editorial written by the New York Times's Paul Krugman. The data includes data such as "status", "commentTitle", and so on. For my research I am only interested in retrieving the body text of the comment (i.e., "commentBody"). So for this initial project I just extracted the "commentBody" from the data using the append property of jQuery, which displays the specified text in the browser on loading.
