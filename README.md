====================

For this intial project I wanted to test javascript's capabilities regarding cleaning and processing text. For the data I used the NYTimes API to retrieve JSON data that contained comments to an editorial written by the New York Times's Paul Krugman. The data includes data such as "status", "commentTitle", and so on. For my research I am only interested in retrieving the body text of the comment (i.e., "commentBody"). So for this initial project I just extracted the "commentBody" from the data using the append property of jQuery, which displays the specified text in the browser on loading.

For future projects I'll need to determine how to proceed with using this JSON data. When I was conceptualizing this project I did not anticipate using the data for anything other than my own personal use as part of my research. However, I could clean the data and present it in a tabular format for others to view on a website related to my research. The table might have the comment body, the comment's rank as determined by readers of the editorial, and the evaluated comment's rating as determined by the text-analysis application and a model of comment quality I develop.

One issue I had was when I added more comments to my javascript file my laptop slowed down to the point of being unusable. I'm not sure if the problem lies with my laptop (4gb memory, ubuntu) or with javascript.

In terms of my progress in the course, I have had trouble negotiating the javascript and programming terminology in the readings. I think with the upcoming focus on javascript and browser interactions and the DOM I'll start to figure it out. 

Simple word count function: 

function wordCount (text) {
	return "The number of words in your text is: " + text.split([" "]).length;
}
