In 1855 Walt Whitman promulgated an ecstatic and exalted vision of democracy in \"song of Myself.\" Several decades later in his \"democratic Vistas\" he descended into despair when confronted with the crass reality of social division, greed, the ascent of the robber barons which dashed the optimism he nurtured in 1855. These two works of a great American writer mirror the statements of Dr. Krugman and Mr. James. To my great chagrin I must side with Mr. James.","approveDate":"1373034183","recommendations":43,"replies":[],"editorsSelection":true,"times_people":1,"sharing":0,"email_status":"0","display_name":"gpd","location":"Riverdale New York","userComments":"api.nytimes.com\/svc\/community\/v2\/comments\/user\/id\/23271686.xml"};

Correct as he most often is, Professor Krugman has obviously shut his eyes on matters of 'democracy'.  He completely ignores the recent (THIS WEEK) assaults on Women's Rights, Voting Rights and others essential to the life of 'democracy'.","approveDate":"1373051678","recommendations":23,"replies":[],"editorsSelection":true,"times_people":1,"sharing":1,"email_status":"0","display_name":"sandyg","location":"austin, texas","userComments":"api.nytimes.com\/svc\/community\/v2\/comments\/user\/id\/15565797.xml"};
